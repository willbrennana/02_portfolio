# Willy B's Coding Commits

After giving this project much consideration, I decided to designate my portfolio site as a space to explore works in progress. Adoptin a more personal take on a professional portfolio.

The more I learn and develop, the further this site will evolve into a gallery of finished, usable, consumer-facing products.

But for now, it will help me unpack class materials, instructor feedback and "aha" moments to come.

That being said, please note that any "snapshot" of my portfolio—current or future—is a work in progress.

As specified in the Challenge Acceptance Criteria, the site includes the following:

✨ Name and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.
(Note: Photo is on LinkedIn. No photo or avatar is on this site for the same reason it's not on my resumé. It's tacky.)

✨ The links in the navigation scroll to the corresponding sections.

✨ The first application's image is larger in size than the others.

✨ The title of the first application takes you to the deployed application.
(Note: Text and imagery are separate for design reasons.)

✨ The page or view has a responsive layout that adapts to a variety of viewports.

Below is a screenshot of my latest and greatest:
